            </div>
            <p class="text">Cycling is packed with adventure, skill, speed, daring, quick thinking and sometimes
                teamwork to make it one of the best recreational sports in the modern world.
                Cycling is mainly an aerobic activity, which means that your heart, blood vessels and lungs all get a
                workout. You will breathe deeper, perspire and experience increased body temperature, which will improve
                your overall fitness level.
                <br><br>
                Cycling is a healthy, low-impact exercise that can be enjoyed by people of all ages, from young children
                to older adults. It is also fun, cheap and good for the environment.
                Whether you’re using it for exercise or transportation, biking is a great way to stay active and explore
                the world around you.

                <h2 class="desc1">PARAGLIDING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">
                It’s one of the rawest and most pure forms of flight. It involves the
                use of a paraglider, where the pilot sits in a harness which is suspended by a large, curved fabric
                wing. There is no engine, pilots launch by running and obtaining lift. The curve in the wing enables a
                skilled pilot to glide over long distances and to climb to high altitudes. Steering is conducted by
                pulling handles which are located beside each shoulder.
                <br><br>
                Paragliding is one of the simplest forms of flight and easiest to get involved in. It’s a popular hobby
                for those who not only enjoy the skill and thrill of flight, but also enjoy the outdoors and the amazing
                overhead views obtainable.However, like other forms of flight, paragliding takes time to learn and
                master. There are dangers involved and loss of control, sudden weather change, or mishandled equipment
                can result in death.

                <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
            </div>
            <p class="text">Surfing is a surface water sport in which an individual, a surfer (or two in tandem
                surfing), uses a board to ride on the forward section, or face, of a moving wave of water, which usually
                carries the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found on ocean shores,
                but can also be found in standing waves in the open ocean, in lakes, in rivers in the form of a tidal
                bore, or in wave pools.
                <br><br>
                The term surfing refers to a person riding a wave using a board, regardless of the stance.
